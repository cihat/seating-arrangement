# Seating Arrangement for school's Library.

## This is a school project I did to solve the problems I saw in the library.

### Reason for Starting the Project (SUMMARY)
In the library at our school, I have observed that there is a lot of confusion as to the seating arrangement/row. As students, I observed that there were grievances arising from this irregularity. These grievances are that students cannot find a place and they stand for long periods of time. One of the biggest reasons for this is to reserve a place for a student friend who arrives earlier.

### The Innovative Aspect of the Project (SUMMARY):
The biggest benefit of the project is not to keep us students waiting any longer and everyone's place is determined in a more regular way.

### Methods to be applied (SUMMARY):
All students have to enter the turnstiles with their school card, by choosing their seat from the panel. The break times of each session/session will be certain, so for the time being, as an example, a long break of 1 hour and unlimited 30 minutes, but I think we can provide order by introducing conditions such as being active after 45 minutes if used.

### Economic and National Gains (SUMMARY): 
We can save energy by turning off the lights in places where there is no residence. If we solve this problem correctly, it can be applied in other universities in this way.
